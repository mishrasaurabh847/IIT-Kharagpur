# DA-16: COVID Detection using Chest X-Ray Images

## Project Code: DA-16

This repository focuses on detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using various classifiers. The project involves feature extraction from the images, dataset splitting, and the application of Bayesian Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC, and Confusion Matrix are reported for each model.

## Note:
The Jupyter notebook explains everything that has been done in the project.

## Features

1. **Image Feature Extraction:**
   - Utilizes advanced tools for extracting relevant features from chest X-ray images.
   - Details about the tools and extraction procedures are documented in the project.

2. **Dataset Splitting:**
   - The train dataset is split into 90-10% for training and validation, respectively.
   - A separate test dataset is reserved for final model evaluation.

3. **Classification Models:**
   - Bayesian Classifier
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation Metrics:

Performance of each classification model is assessed using the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- AUC-ROC
- Confusion Matrix

## Dataset:

The chest X-ray dataset used in this project can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1drmV1adl5B8_msbJNAJMIgqvki30qdC3/view?usp=sharing).
